# Version: 1.0.0
# 
# Script has been verified to run against Windows 2008 servers
# 
# Purpose: This script was designed to reboot servers one at a time. 
# The script reboots the first server and waits until a specific service is online before rebooting the next server.
# The script can be modified to verify if a web service or application service is running
# The script will not start rebooting unless all servers are online.
# and an email notification will be sent.
# The script will not continue if a server does not come back online after reboot
#  and an email notification will be sent.
